            The Chris Lynch Fencing system analysis project involoved elvaluating and recommending improvements for a family owned fencing company operating across multiple Hawaiian islands. The project identified ineffciencies in inventory
            tracking and job estimating, both of which were being managed manually through spreadsheets and paper calculation. Through system analysis and designs practices, I assessed the company's needs, researched alternative software,
            and proposed a cloud based platform, FieldBin to streamline operations. This project highlights the importance of system analysis and design in unbderstanding user requirements, evaluating technical solutions that enhance operational 
            effciency, accuracy, and scalability.

            The Habit Tracker Application project involved designing and building a Java based system to manage clients and track user habits over time. The application allowed users to add new clients, update client records
            and log daily, weekly, or custom habits, providing structured tracking and reporting features. This project highlights key software development concepts such as object oriented programming, data management, user input validation
            and modular design. It also emphaized the importance of maintainable code structure, effective error handling, and usability in creating real world applications. Through this project I demostrated how Java can 
            be used to build scalable and efficient applications that manage dynamic data while delivering and organized, user friendly experience.

            The Case Management project focused on modernizing the Montana Judical Branch's court operations by managing the project through a structured project management framework. As the project manager, I 
            coordinated the development of a digital system to replace outdated, paper based process, aiiming to improve case tracking, information accessibility, and operational efficiency. Applying core project management 
            principles including planning, scheduling, budgeting, stakeholder engagement, and risk management. This project demonstrated how project management ensures that large scal organizational changes are delivered on time, 
            within budget, and aligned with strategic goals, ultimately creating sustainable improvements in workflow, accountability, and public service devlivery.

            The Appointment Schedular project involved building a .NET based application with integrated web services to streamline scheduling for patients and healthcare providers. The system allowed users to book,
            update, cancel, and view appointments securely while managing doctor availability and patient records. The project demonstrated key skills in developing connected applications using .NET technologies, web services,
            data validation, and secure communication between client and server. It emphasized the importance of application reliability, responsive user interfaces, and backend service integration in healthcare environments
            where accuracy and confidentiality are critical.

            The Airport Database project involved creating a structued, efficient relational database to support key operations at a modern airport, including flight scheduling, passenger management, baggage tracking, and 
            employee assignments. Using best practices from modern database systems I designed tables, relationsships, and queries that ensure data integrity, minimized redundancy through normalization, and optimized performance
            for transactional workloads. Thsi project illustrates the importance of throughtful database architecture in enabling real tome access to critical informatio, supporting operational decision making and ensuring
            scalability for future growth. It also emphasized essential database system concepts such as indexing and security.

            The Delta Dental Data Breach project examined how vulnerabilities in third party software applications, like MOVEit, can lead to major cybersecurity incidents impacting millions of individuals. This case
            study highlighted the critical role of application security in protecting sensitive personal and finanical information, especially in industries like healthcare and insurance. Through this project I explored how 
            weakness such as outdated systems, lack of encryption, poor network segmentation, and delayed breach detection contributed tot the exposure of personally identifiable information and protected health information.
            It demonstrated that strong application security practices such as regular patching, secure software development, continous monitoring, third party risk management are essential for safeguarding data against
            increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Thsi project emphasized how maintaing robust application security is fundamental not only for compliance with standards like HIPPA but also for protecting organizational 
            reputation and customer trust.

            The Flower Shop Application project involved develoing a Java based store where users could browse a selection of flowers, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases. The system managed product
            listings, inventory updates, and customer information, and order processing using oject oriented design principles. This project emphasized the importance of building user friendly interfaces, handling transcations
            securely, and maintaining accurate inventory management behind the scenes. It also highlighted how Java can be used to create real world web applications by applying concepts like file sotrage, exception handling, and
            dynamic user input.
