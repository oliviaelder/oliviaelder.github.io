            The Chris Lynch Fencing system analysis project involoved elvaluating and recommending improvements for a family owned fencing company operating across multiple Hawaiian islands. The project identified ineffciencies in inventory
            tracking and job estimating, both of which were being managed manually through spreadsheets and paper calculation. Through system analysis and designs practices, I assessed the company's needs, researched alternative software,
            and proposed a cloud based platform, FieldBin to streamline operations. This project highlights the importance of system analysis and design in unbderstanding user requirements, evaluating technical solutions that enhance operational 
            effciency, accuracy, and scalability.

            The Case Management project focused on modernizing the Montana Judical Branch's court operations by managing the project through a structured project management framework. As the project manager, I 
            coordinated the development of a digital system to replace outdated, paper based process, aiiming to improve case tracking, information accessibility, and operational efficiency. Applying core project management 
            principles including planning, scheduling, budgeting, stakeholder engagement, and risk management. This project demonstrated how project management ensures that large scal organizational changes are delivered on time, 
            within budget, and aligned with strategic goals, ultimately creating sustainable improvements in workflow, accountability, and public service devlivery.

            The Airport Database project involved creating a structued, efficient relational database to support key operations at a modern airport, including flight scheduling, passenger management, baggage tracking, and 
            employee assignments. Using best practices from modern database systems I designed tables, relationsships, and queries that ensure data integrity, minimized redundancy through normalization, and optimized performance
            for transactional workloads. Thsi project illustrates the importance of throughtful database architecture in enabling real tome access to critical informatio, supporting operational decision making and ensuring
            scalability for future growth. It also emphasized essential database system concepts such as indexing and security.

            The Delta Dental Data Breach project examined how vulnerabilities in third party software a[[lications, like MOVEit, can lead to major cybersecurity incidents impacting millions of individuals. This case
            study highlighted the critical role of application security in protecting sensitive personal and finanical information, especially in industries like healthcare and insurance. Through this project I explored how 
            weakness such as outdated systems, lack of encryption, poor network segmentation, and delayed breach detection contributed tot the exposure of personally identifiable information and protected health information.
            It demonstrated that strong application security practices such as regular patching, secure software development, continous monitoring, third party risk management are essential for safeguarding data against
            increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Thsi project emphasized how maintaing robust application security is fundamental not only for compliance with standards like HIPPA but also for protecting organizational 
            reputation and customer trust.
