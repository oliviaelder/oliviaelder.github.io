          <h3>Project 1: System Analysis & Design â€“ Chris Lynch Fencing</h3>
          <p>          
            The Chris Lynch Fencing System Analysis Project involved evaluating and recommending improvements for a family owned fencing company operating across multiple Hawaiian Islands. The project identified  inefficiencies in inventory
            tracking and job estimating, both of which were being managed manually through spreadsheets and paper calculation. Through system analysis and designs practices, I assessed the company's needs, researched alternative software,
            and proposed a cloud based platform, FieldBin to streamline operations. This project highlights the importance of system analysis and design in understanding user requirements, evaluating technical solutions that enhance operational 
            efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

          <h3>Project 2: Habit Tracker</h3>
          <p> 
            The Habit Tracker Application Project involved designing and building a React-based Single-Page Web Application that communicates with a local API to manage clients and track user habits over time. The application allowed users to add
            new clients, update clients and log habits, providing structured tracking and reporting features. This project highlights the features of a data-driven React application that interacts with APIs, manipulates local data storage (db.json), 
            and can be displayed in a nice web interface without relying on a full backend server.

          <h3>Project 3: Case Management System</h3>
          <p>
                      
            The Case Management Project focused on modernizing the Montana Judicial Branch's court operations by managing the project through a structured project management framework. As the project manager, I 
            coordinated the development of a digital system to replace outdated, paper based process, aiming to improve case tracking, information accessibility, and operational efficiency. Applying core project management 
            principles including planning, scheduling, budgeting, stakeholder engagement, and risk management. This project demonstrated how project management ensures that large scale organizational changes are delivered on time, 
            within budget, and aligned with strategic goals, ultimately creating sustainable improvements in workflow, accountability, and public service delivery.

          <h3>Project 4: Appointment Scheduler</h3>
          <p>

           The Appointment Scheduler Project involved building an ASP.NET MVC web application with entity framework. This project automatically generates a database and includes integrated web services to streamline scheduling 
            for patients and healthcare providers. The system allowed users to book, update, cancel, and view appointments securely while managing doctor availability and patient records. The project demonstrated key skills in developing 
            connected applications using .NET technologies, web services, entity framework and Razor page views embedded with C# in the HTML.

          <h3>Project 5: Database Design â€“ Airport Project</h3>
          <p>
     
            The Airport Database Project involved creating a structured, efficient relational database to support key operations at a modern airport, including flight scheduling, passenger management, baggage tracking, and 
            employee assignments. Using best practices from modern database systems I designed tables, relationships, and queries that ensure data integrity, minimized redundancy through normalization, and optimized performance
            for transactional workloads. This project illustrates the importance of thoughtful database architecture in enabling real time access to critical information, supporting operational decision making and ensuring
            scalability for future growth. It also emphasized essential database system concepts such as indexing and security.

          <h3>Project 6: Application Security â€“ Delta Dental</h3>
          <p>
          
            The Delta Dental Data Breach Project examined how vulnerabilities in third party software applications, like MOVEit, can lead to major cybersecurity incidents impacting millions of individuals. This case
            study highlighted the critical role of application security in protecting sensitive personal and financial information, especially in industries like healthcare and insurance. Through this project I explored how 
            weakness such as outdated systems, lack of encryption, poor network segmentation, and delayed breach detection contributed to the exposure of personally identifiable information and protected health information.
            It demonstrated that strong application security practices such as regular patching, secure software development, continuous monitoring, and third party risk management are essential for safeguarding data against
            increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This project emphasized how maintaining robust application security is fundamental not only for compliance with standards like HIPPA but also for protecting organizational 
            reputation and customer trust.

          <h3>Project 7: Flower Shop</h3>
          <p>
            The Flower Shop Application project involved developing a React-based Single Page Web Application that communicates with an API to display and manipulate data.  It allowed users to browse a selection of flowers, 
            add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases. The system managed product listings, inventory updates, customer information, and order processing using multiple views, JavaScript for data validity and logic. 
            This project emphasized the importance of building user friendly interfaces, handling transactions securely, and maintaining accurate inventory management behind the scenes. It also highlighted how CSS files can be used to 
            create stylish web pages and JavaScript can be used for handling dynamic user input.

          <h3>Project 8: Youth Court Services â€“ Judicial District 1 Annual Report</h3>
          <p>
            The Judicial District 1 Annual Report Project involved developing a comprehensive year-end report summarizing juvenile probation activity within District 1. The report includes key data such as the number of 
            referrals received, types of offenses, case outcomes, and trends over time.

            This project demonstrates how Visual Studio SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) can be utilized to create clear, user-friendly reports. It also highlights the importance of efficient SQL Server database querying to 
            deliver fast, accurate, and high-quality results.
